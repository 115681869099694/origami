There are the four main windows in Quartz Composer:

* Editor Window

The Editor Window is the workspace of Quartz Composer&mdash;where you create and edit your prototype by adding patches and connecting them together.

* Viewer Window

The Viewer Window is where you see the results of your work and where you're able to interact with your prototype.

* Inspector

The Inspector is one place to specify values for patch inputs and specify other patch settings. To open the Inspector, click a patch in the Editor Window and click "Inspector" on the Quartz Composer toolbar (or press Cmd-I). You can also specify patch input values inline on the patches themselves.

* Patch Library

The Patch Library is how you add patches to your prototype. It contains a comprehensive list of all patches and their descriptions. To open the Patch ibrary, click "Patch Library" on the Quartz Composer toolbar (or press Cmd-Return). To add a patch in the Patch Library, double-click it or press return.
