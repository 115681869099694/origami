<h2 class='studio-soon'>WYSIWYG Canvas</h4>

The Canvas is a visual editing workspace where you can drag your patches around visually. You can define the positions of your layers as well as interactions and animations visually just by dragging and resizing your layers.

## Graph

A patching environment similar to Quartz Composer&mdash;where you edit the details of interactions in your prototype by adding patches and connecting them together with noodles.

<h2 class="studio">Layer Sidebar</h2>

A list of layers in your composition. Clicking the triangle to the right of a layer opens it and allows you to edit its properties.

Reordering and nesting layers is as easy as dragging them. You can select multiple layers and press command-g to group them.

## Viewer

The Viewer Window is where you see the results of your work and where you're able to interact with your prototype.

The viewer can be moved into a separate window, so it can be fullscreen on another monitor or OS X Space.

## Patch Library

The Patch Library is how you add patches to your prototype. It contains a comprehensive list of all patches and their descriptions. To open the Patch Library, double click in the Graph, or hit command-return. To add a patch that you've selected in the Patch Library, double-click it or press return.
