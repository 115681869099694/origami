* What is Quartz Composer?

Quartz Composer is a freely-available motion graphics tool by Apple that has existed for Mac OS X since 2004. Primarily a tool for graphical projections and screen savers, Quartz Composer was never seen as an ideal interaction design tool. The underlying technologies behind Quartz Composer however&mdash;OpenGL and Core Image&mdash;are powerful.


* What is Origami?

Origami is a toolkit for Quartz Composer that makes interaction design prototyping easy and doesn't require programming. The toolkit includes core patches like Layer that provide display options like positioning-in-pixels and opacity control as well as important core additions to Quartz Composer such as Retina display support.
