<a class="action-button" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id942636206" target="_blank">Download Origami Live</a>

You can try your prototypes on your iPhone or iPad over USB with [Origami Live](http://itunes.apple.com/app/id942636206) &mdash; currently iOS only.

## Using Origami Live
After downloading Origami Live from the App Store, simply open Quartz Composer, plug in your device to your computer, and then open Origami Live. Your current prototype will automatically show up, and you can immediately interact with the prototype. You can even use your prototype while adjusting it in Quartz Composer.

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes the Origami Live may not reflect the composition you want, or any composition at all. In these situations:

<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>Make sure you are using the supported Origami Layer patches (Sprites, Billboards and other non-Origami blue consumer patches are not supported).</li>
	<li>Make sure you've placed all your patches/Layers inside the main Layer Group connected to the Viewer patch.</li>
	<li>Only have a single document open at a time.</li>
	<li>Force quit/restart Origami Live and Quartz Composer.</li>
</ul>
