* What is Origami Studio

Origami Studio is a free interaction prototyping tool from facebook inspired by our usage of Quartz Composer with Origami. Studio is a standalone Mac app, in contrast to the previous version of Origami, which was built as a plugin to Quartz Composer.

Quartz Composer was a freely-available motion graphics tool by Apple that has existed for Mac OS X since 2004. Primarily a tool for graphical projections and screen savers, Quartz Composer was never seen as an ideal interaction design tool.
