  desc: |
    This patch lets you animate a value using a spring animation. The Pop Animation patch is the more modern version of this patch with easier to use controls and Code Export support, so it&rsquo;s recommended that you use it instead. However, if you&rsquo;re trying to animate something in an Iterator, you'll usually want to use this patch instead of Pop Animation since this will be able to animate each iteration independently.

    The number can be optionally constrained within a boundary that starts at 0 and wraps after a maximum number of values has been reached. Incrementing at the end value will wrap back around to the start value and decrementing at the start value will wrap back around to the end value. To set a constraint, set the Maximum Count port to a value greater than 0. If the counter is constrained, the Jump to Number value must fall within bounds, otherwise it will be wrapped according to the boundary.

        These last two options are useful for only delaying one direction of an animation. e.g. you want a window to animate on screen immediately, but animate off screen after a delay. You'd connect the Switch that holds this state to a Delay patch and set the Style to Delay Decreasing, so the delay only takes effect when the Switch turns off. You'd then connect the Delay patch to an animation patch.

  desc: |
    A switch that supports more than two states. Index Switches are useful for holding a state that is one of several options, e.g. a tab bar or menu item selection.
    
    Each Input port takes a pulse. When it receives the pulse, the value of the switch will be changed to the port number that was pulsed. For example, if you pulse the Input 2 port, the Index Switch will output the value 2.
    
    Change the number of states by selecting the Index Switch patch and opening the Patch Settings inspector.

  desc: |
    Lets you get touches on Layer patches (Layer, Text Layer, Hit Area, etc) or the whole screen. To get touches on a Layer patch, connect the top right port on the Interaction 2 patch to the top left port of the Layer patch.

    Touches are prioritized by whichever Layer is on top (layer order is shown in the top right of a Layer patch, higher number on top). If using on a Layer Group, touches will be sent to any Layers inside the Layer Group (counter this by attaching Interaction 2 patches to inside Layers, and disabling them).
  inputs:
    - name: Enable
      desc: When this is off, the layer will be opted out of the interaction system. If you have a layer you don't want to be interactive (say a styling image) that&rsquo;s covering another layer that you want to get interactions on, connect an Interaction 2 patch to it and turn Enable off. That will let touches pass through it to the layer below.
  outputs:
    - name: Down
      desc: Outputs a 1 when the touch is down on the layer.
    - name: Up
      desc: Outputs a pulse once the touch has been released from the layer as long as the touch is inside of the layer. This is recommended for most buttons.
    - name: Tap
      desc: Outputs a pulse once the touch has been released from the layer as long as the touch hasn't moved. This is recommended for buttons that are also scrollable or swappable. This port lets you distinguish a touch meant to swipe the button or a group containing the button from and a touch meant to tap the button. In all other cases, buttons should use the Up port.
    - name: Drag
      desc: Outputs a 1 if the touch started down on the layer and stays 1 until the touch is released (even if you move off the layer). Useful for prototyping drag-and-drop or scrubbing interactions.

    Change the key/add more key outputs in Patch Settings.
  outputs:
    - name: Key ' '
      desc: Outputs a 1 if the key is pressed, and a 0 if not.

switch:
  name: Switch
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: Flip
      desc: Takes a pulse to flip the state of the switch. If the switch is off this will turn it on, and if it&rsquo;s on, this will turn it off.
    - name: Turn Off
      desc: Takes a pulse to turn the switch off. If it&rsquo;s already off, sending a pulse to this port will have no effect.
    - name: Turn On
      desc: Takes a pulse to turn the switch on. If it&rsquo;s already on, sending a pulse to this port will have no effect.
  outputs:
    - name: On / Off
      desc: Outputs a 0 if the switch is off and a 1 if it&rsquo;s on.
  desc: |
    A Switch remembers a state. It works just like a light switch &mdash; it starts out as off, when you flip it it&rsquo;ll turn on, and then if you flip it again it&rsquo;ll turn off. For example, if you wanted to tap a photo and have it zoom in and stay that way when you release your finger, you could hook up the button tap to a Switch which would remember whether the photo should be zoomed in or not.
    
    The Flip port is useful for a symmetrical interaction &mdash; e.x. tapping a photo repeatedly to zoom it to large and small sizes. The Turn On and Turn Off port are useful for other interactions where you have different actions to control the switch. For example, for a compose window, you might have the compose button turn on the switch (animating in the window) and the Cancel and Done buttons in the window turning off the switch.
    
progress:
  name: Progress
  type: processor
  desc: |
    Outputs where a value is located between a Start and End value. If the value is at the Start Value, it will output a 0. If it's at the End Value, it will output a 1.

    For example, say you wanted a bar to slide up when you scrolled from one scroll position to another. You'd connect the scroll position to Value and enter the scroll positions to the Start and End values. Then you'll have scrolling inside that range as a 0 to 1 (Progress) value that you could then connect to a Transition patch that slides the bar up.
  inputs:
    - name: Value
      desc: The value between the start and end values.
    - name: Start Value
      desc: The start of the range. When the Value equals the Start Value, the progress will be 0.
    - name: End Value
      desc: The end of the range. When the Value equals the End Value, the progress will be 1.
  outputs:
    - name: Progress
      desc: A number between 0 and 1 that reflects where the value is in the range. If the Value provided is greater or less than the Start/End Value, the Progress output will scale proportionally beyond 0 or 1.

scroll:
  name: Scroll
  type: producer
  desc: |
    Lets you scroll a layer using free, paging, or "wheel of fortune" scrolling.
    
    To use:
    
    First connect the Image or Layer Group you want to scroll to the Scroll and Layer patches' Image ports. This way, the Scroll patch knows the dimensions of what it's scrolling, and the Layer patch knows what Image to display.
    
    Then connect the Scroll patch&rsquo;s X and/or Y positions to the Layer&rsquo;s X and/or Y positions. Important: The Layer's Anchor Point needs to be set to Center to work properly — this is why the Scroll values go from negative to positive (anchored around a center value of 0).
    
    If using multiple Scroll patches, tie each one to a specific layer by connecting the Scroll patch's interaction port on the top right to the Layer's interaction port on the top left. Note: if you are scrolling a Layer Group, layers inside the Layer Group may intercept touch events (see Interaction 2 for more detail).

  inputs:
    - name: Enable
      desc: Turn off to stop touches from scrolling.
    - name: Image
      desc: |
        The image you want to scroll. The patch uses this to determine the size of what you're scrolling. This image should be the same size as the layer that you intend to scroll. This is optional if you specify Content Width/Height in an attached Scroll Settings patch.
        
        Note: The image needs to be wider (if scrolling horizontally) or taller (if scrolling vertically) than the containing Layer Group for it to scroll.
    - name: X Scrolling

  desc: Outputs the location of the mouse or touch on the screen and whether it's down or not. Use the Interaction 2 patch instead if you want touch events for a specific layer.
  outputs:
    - name: X Position
      desc: The horizontal position of the mouse or touch in pixels.
    - name: Y Position
      desc: The vertical position of the mouse or touch in pixels.
    - name: Down
      desc: Outputs true when the mouse is clicked down or the touch is active.

bouncy:
  name: Pop Animation
  type: producer
  inputs:
    - name: Number
      desc: The value you wish to animate. The Pop Animation patch will animate the changes in this value. Typically this is connected to a patch outputting a 0 or 1, like a Switch.
    - name: Bounciness
      desc: How springy the animation will feel, between 0 and 20.
    - name: Speed
      desc: How fast the animation will feel, between 0 and 20.
  outputs:
    - name: Progress
      desc: The animating value. Typically this is an animation between 0 and 1 (0% and 100%) and is connected to Transition patches.
  desc: |
    Animate a changing value with a spring. This is the preferred way to animate in Origami.  You can use the Code Export feature in the Origami menu to use these animations in your products.
  usage: |
    Typically you connect the input of Pop Animation to a Switch representing some state change, and the output to any number of Transitions, controlling different properties in the interface that should change based on the state change in the Switch. These Transitions will move together since their values are derived from the same Pop Animation patch.


multiplexer:
  name: Multiplexer
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: Source Index
      desc: The number (starting at 0) of the Source input you want the Multiplexer to output.
    - name: Source &num;0
      desc: |
        An input of any type. Add more in the Patch Settings.

        Defaults to Virtual (i.e. any type), but can be set to Boolean, Index, Number, Color, String, Image, or Structure in the Patch Settings.
    - name: Source &num;1
      desc: |
        An input of any type. (See above)
  outputs:
    - name: Output
      desc: The Source with the same number as in Source Index.
  desc: |
    Given any number of Source inputs, lets you choose one of them to output by entering a number into Source Index. 

    Think of it like a more advanced Transition patch &mdash; but it can handle more than 2 inputs (adjustable in Patch Settings), and multiple types of inputs. Unlike Transition patches, you cannot smoothly transition in between 2 inputs.

    Often used with an Index Switch or Counter plugged into Source Index to toggle between the Sources (e.g. in a Tab Bar, or advancing through a slideshow)

demultiplexer:
  name: Demultiplexer
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: Destination Index
      desc: The number (starting at 0) of the Destination output you want the input to pass through.
    - name: Input
      desc: |
        An input of any type. Add more in the Patch Settings.

        Defaults to Virtual (i.e. any type), but can be set to Boolean, Index, Number, Color, String, Image, or Structure in the Patch Settings.
    - name: Reset Value
      desc: |
        An input of any type. Hidden by default &mdash; enable it in Patch Settings

        This value will be passed to all Destinations that are not selected.
  outputs:
    - name: Destination &num;1
      desc: Outputs the Input or Reset Value, depending on which Destination Index is selected.
    - name: Destination &num;2
      desc: Outputs the Input or Reset Value, depending on which Destination Index is selected.
    - name: Destination &num;3
      desc: Outputs the Input or Reset Value, depending on which Destination Index is selected.
    - name: Destination &num;4
      desc: Outputs the Input or Reset Value, depending on which Destination Index is selected.
  desc: |
    Given any number of Destinations and an Input, lets you choose one of them to pass the Input value to. 

    Enable the Reset Value (in Patch Settings) to have a default that is passed to all non-selected Destinations.

    Often used with an Index Switch or Counter plugged into Destination Index, with Boolean set as the type &mdash; On as the Input, and Off as the Reset Value. Then the Destinations are often hooked up to different Layer Enable ports to show one at a time (e.g. in a tab bar).

iterator:
  name: Iterator
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: Enable
      desc: Enables the Iterator
    - name: Iterations
      desc: The number of times you want the contents repeated.
  desc: |
    Iterators are an easy way to minimize repetitive patches that do the same thing. They are similar to loops in programming. A common reason to use Iterators is to display many of the same Layers, with different attributes (e.g. a News Feed). This way if you update one Layer you update all of them at the same time &mdash; it will make your prototyping much faster.

    Enter the Iterator by double-clicking on it (or &#8984; + &darr;) and place your patches within. Use [Iterator Info](../Iterator-Info) to get current iteration index numbers to do different things with your patches inside.

    Caveat &mdash; you can only publish values out if there are no blue consumer patches within.

    Read more about working with Iterators [here](../../concepts/Iterators).

iterator-info:
  name: Iterator Info
  type: producer
  outputs:
    - name: Current Index
      desc: The current iteration index/cycle (starting at 0 for the first iteration).
    - name: Current Position
      desc: The current progress between 0 and 1 (think percentage) of the Iterator.
    - name: Iterations
      desc: The total number times the containing Iterator will repeat.
  desc: |
    Used inside [Iterators](../Iterator). Provides information to use to do different things with patches depending on the iteration index.

    Caveat &mdash; in the editor, only the last iteration index is visible for debugging. Read more about Iterators [here](../../concepts/Iterators).
