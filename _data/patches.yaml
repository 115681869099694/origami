3d-orientation:
  name: 3D Orientation
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: 3D Orientation
      desc: Takes a structure containing 'pitch', 'roll', and 'yaw' keys, usually provided by the Device Info patch.
  outputs:
    - name: Pitch
      desc: Outputs the pitch of the 3D orientation.
    - name: Roll
      desc: Outputs the roll of the 3D orientation.
    - name: Yaw
      desc: Outputs the yaw of the 3D orientation.
  desc: |
    This is a convenience patch that breaks out the 3D Orientation from the Device Info patch into pitch, roll, and yaw values you can use in your prototypes. These values reflect the physical orientation of your connected device running Origami Live. Try plugging these values into text layers and watch how the values change as you rotate your device.

border:
  name: Border
  type: consumer
  inputs:
    - name: Enable
      desc: Turns the border on and off.
    - name: Thickness
      desc: How thick the border is in pixels on each edge.
    - name: Color
      desc: The color of the border.
    - name: Alpha
      desc: Adjusts the opacity of the border.
  desc: |
    Draws a border of a given thickness and color around the edges of the layer group it&rsquo;s inside of. The border is similar to an inner stroke and has rectangular corners.


bouncy-animation:
  name: Bouncy Animation
  type: producer
  inputs:
    - name: Number
      desc: The number to animate. Usually a 0 or 1 value from a Switch or an Interaction patch.
    - name: Friction
      desc: The friction of the spring animation.
    - name: Tension
      desc: The tension of the spring animation.
  outputs:
    - name: Progress
      desc: The current value of the animation. Usually between or around 0 and 1.
  desc: |
    This patch lets you animate a value using a spring animation. The Pop Animation patch is the more modern version of this patch with easier to use controls and Code Export support, so it&rsquo;s recommended that you use it instead. However, if you&rsquo;re trying to animate something in an Iterator, you'll usually want to use this patch instead of Pop Animation since this will be able to animate each iteration independently. 

browser-chrome:
  name: Browser Chrome
  type: consumer
  inputs:
    - name: Enable
      desc: Enable or disable the theming of the Viewer window.
    - name: Window Title
      desc: Set the title of the Viewer window. 10.9 only.
    - name: URL
      desc: URL to display in the address bar.
    - name: Favicon
      desc: Takes a 16 px square image and displays it in the address bar. 10.9 only.

      desc: Enables or disables the back button in the toolbar.
    - name: Enable Forward
      desc: Enables or disables the forward button in the toolbar.
  desc: Styles the viewer window to look like a web browser when the composition is running. Click the right most toolbar button to stop the viewer. The back and forward buttons are accessible through the Browser Buttons patch.

browser-buttons:
  name: Browser Buttons
  type: producer
  outputs:
    - name: Back
      desc: A boolean that changes between 0 and 1 based on if the back button is down or not.
    - name: Forward
      desc: A boolean that changes between 0 and 1 based on if the forward button is down or not.
  desc: Gives you the state of the back and forward buttons from the Browser Chrome patch. Useful for prototyping navigating between pages on the desktop web.

switch:
  name: Switch
  type: processor
  inputs:
    - name: Flip
      desc: Takes a pulse to flip the state of the switch. If the switch is off this will turn it on, and if it&rsquo;s on, this will turn it off.
    - name: Turn Off
      desc: Takes a pulse to turn the switch off. If it&rsquo;s already off, sending a pulse to this port will have no effect.
    - name: Turn On
      desc: Takes a pulse to turn the switch on. If it&rsquo;s already on, sending a pulse to this port will have no effect.
  outputs:
    - name: On / Off
      desc: Outputs a 0 if the switch is off and a 1 if it&rsquo;s on.
  desc: |
    A Switch remembers a state. It works just like a light switch &mdash; it starts out as off, when you flip it it&rsquo;ll turn on, and then if you flip it again it&rsquo;ll turn off. For example, if you wanted to tap a photo and have it zoom in and stay that way when you release your finger, you could hook up the button tap to a Switch which would remember whether the photo should be zoomed in or not.
    
    The Flip port is useful for a symmetrical interaction &mdash; e.x. tapping a photo repeatedly to zoom it to large and small sizes. The Turn On and Turn Off port are useful for other interactions where you have different actions to control the switch. For example, for a compose window, you might have the compose button turn on the switch (animating in the window) and the Cancel and Done buttons in the window turning off the switch.

progress:
  name: Progress
  type: processor
  desc: |
    Takes a value in a given range and outputs a value between 0 and 1 representing where the value is in the range.
    
    Progress is the opposite of Transition, since Transition converts a 0-1 value to a Range, whereas Progress converts a range to a 0-1 value.

  inputs:
    - name: Minimum
      desc: The lower end of the range. 
    - name: Maximum
      desc: The upper end of the range.
    - name: Value
      desc: A value that you wish to redefine in terms of the Minimum - Maximum range. Its value may be lower than Minimum or higher than Maxumum. This may happen for example with you have a bouncy that exceeds its target value or the user is rubber-banding within a scrollable range.
  outputs:
    - name: Progress
      desc: |
        A value between 0 and 1 describing Value as a percent of the distance between Minumum and Maxumum. If Value is equal to Minimum, Progress will be 0.

        If the Value is less than Minimum, Progress will be < 0 proportionally.

        If Value is equal to Maximum, Progress will be 1. If the Value is greater than Maximum, Progress will be > 1 proportionally.


transition:
  name: Transition
  type: processor
  desc: |
    Converts a 0-1 value to a range of output values between Start Value and End Value. Transition patches allow you to interpolate between two values based on a dynamic value.

  usage: |
    Transition patches are commonly connected between Animation patches to properties on layers so the animation progress can control a number of properties changing between their start and end values.
    
    You can connect multiple transition patches in series to interpolate between multiple states. If there are 3 possible values for states A, B, and C to interpolate between: connect values for A and B to one transition, whose Value represents progress from A to B, then connect its output to the Start Value of a second transition that represents progress towards state C.

  inputs:
    - name: Progress
      desc: 0-1 value that represents how far along a transition you are
    - name: Start Value
      desc: Output value corresponding to the beginning of the transition
    - name: End Value
      desc: Output value corresponding to the end of the transition
  outputs:
    - name: Value
      desc: The interpolated value

    Pop Animation is the most common way to animate a value in a physical way.  It uses a configurable bouncy curve (or spring-mass system) to move Progress towards Number. You can interrupt this animation at any time by changing the Number input, and Pop Animation will preserve the current velocity of the animation, giving a physically realistic feeling to your interface.

    When converting your design to code, you can use the open-source [POP animation library](https://github.com/facebook/pop "Facebook POP animation library") to build animations for iOS.

  usage: |
    Typically you connect the input of Pop Animation to a Switch representing some state change, and the output to any number of Transitions, controlling different properties in the interface that should change based on the state change in the Switch. These Transitions will move together since their values are derived from the same Pop Animation patch.
